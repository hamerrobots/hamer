# Halikarnas Modular Education Robot (HAMER) - Version 1.3.1
HAMER is a robotic project that is being developed for robotic education. This repository contains ROS Melodic (branch: melodic-devel) and ROS Noetic (branch: noeitc-devel) compatible robot packages of HAMER robot.
This metapackage includes the following subpackages.

- hamer_bringup: It is a subpackage containing hardware control of HAMER robot.
- hamer_description: It is the subpackage containing urdf files of the HAMER robot.
- hamer_navigation: It is the subpackage containing the navigation package files of the HAMER robot.
- hamer_simulation: It is a sub-package containing the package and launch files required for the simulation of the HAMER robot.
- hamer_slam: It is a sub-package containing the package and launch files required for mapping of the HAMER robot.
- hamer_teleop: It is a sub-package containing the codes required to control the HAMER robot from the keyboard in a simulated or hardware environment.

NOTE: Before running keyboard code, run on terminal this codes:
        
        $ cd ~/hamer_teleop/scripts
        $ chmod +x hamer_teleop.py
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:
--------------

- In order for the sensors to work properly, "gazebo_ros_pkgs" files must be downloaded to your workspace.

        $ git clone https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs.git -b noetic-devel
        
- In order for the SLAM to work, "slam_gmapping" package must be downloaded to your workspace.
    
        $ git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping.git -b noetic-devel
        
- In order for the "joint_state_publisher" to work, "joint_state_publisher_gui" package must be downloaded to your computer.

        $ sudo apt update
        $ sudo apt install ros-melodic-joint-state-publisher-gui
        
- In order for the navigation package to work, "follow_waypoint" package must be downloaded to your workspace.
(Waypoints package added and the default goal tolerance increased to 0.3 from 0.0 in phyton script to ease robot's movement.)

        $ git clone https://github.com/danielsnider/follow_waypoints
